# incapsula-miner
MineMeld Miner for Incapsula public IPs implemented as an extension

## How it works

This Miner periodically checks Imperva's Incapsula API (https://my.incapsula.com/api/integration/v1/ips) for updates to the list of IP addresses associated with their WAF service.

## Installation

You can install this extension directly from the git repo
